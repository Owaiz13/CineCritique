                <h2>Scratched my head off with this nonsensical sequel</h2>
                <p>If you are about to book a ticket for this movie going by the collections in the news, stop right now. A complete demolition of the image and fanbase created by the original Gadar, this movie showcases why it was made - just to mint money in the shadow of the former legendary film. With no planning, script or direction, this movie will bore the hell out of you and you will be left regretting your decision of booking the tickets. A three hour of complete nonsense in any manner you take it. A child could write a better script. Sunny deol is depicted as a superman too, taking on hundreds of men armed with guns and that too multiple times - barehanded. LOL.</p>
